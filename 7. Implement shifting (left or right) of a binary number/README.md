# Implement shifting to the right and shifting to the left of a binery number
Extend the previous app so now you have another operation included in it.
The new operation should implement the moving of N positions of a binary number, to the left or to the right (shift left, shift right).

On the first line the app gets the operation code:

1 - conversion from 10 to base 2

2 - conversion from base 2 to base 10

3 - apply the NOT operator on the entered binary number

4 - apply the OR operator on the entered binary number(s)

5 - apply the AND operator on the entered binary number(s)

6 - apply the XOR operator on the entered binary number(s)

7 - shifting to the left (shift left) N positions for a given binary number

8 - shifting to the right (shift right) N positions for a given binary number

On the next line(s), the number or numbers will be entered, upon which function(s) will be executed (a number on each line).

Example:

Input:
7
1011
2

Output:
101100

Example:

Input:
8
10111
3

Output:
10

Example:

Input:
8
10111
-1

Output:
The shifting position number should be a positive integer.
